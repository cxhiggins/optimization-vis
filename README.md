# Optimization Visualization

This repository creates 3D visualizations of common optimization algorithms used for finding local minima of differentiable functions. It was inspired by the content of my first year Continuous Mathematics course, implemented using Python, Plotly, Dash and Numpy, and hosted with Heroku.
